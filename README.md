## ⚠️ Early Development

**Logistics is in active development.** Core pipe transport works, but expect rough edges, missing features, and the occasional bug. Report issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/indemnity83/logistics/issues) if something breaks.

## About

Logistics is a Fabric mod inspired by BuildCraft and Logistics Pipes, bringing authentic item pipe systems to modern Minecraft. Items travel smoothly through thin pipes with visible motion, integrating seamlessly with other mods via Fabric's Transfer API.

**Design Principles:**
- **Material-Based Identity** - Each pipe uses distinct vanilla materials for visual clarity
- **Layered Progression** - Three tiers: Mechanical pipes (basic operations), Smart pipes (decisions), Network logistics (abstract services)
- **Authentic Visuals** - Items travel continuously through pipes with visible speed
- **Mod Interoperability** - Works with any mod using Fabric Transfer API (ItemStorage)
- **Classic Ergonomics** - Simple placement, visible connections, easy to understand

---

## How It Works

Logistics is built on a **three-tier system** that grows with your world progression. All three tiers are implemented.

### Tier 1: Mechanical Pipes (Implemented)
**Basic routing without item awareness**

Start here. These pipes perform mechanical operations—moving, merging, extracting, deleting—but they don't look at what's flowing through them. They just do their job, every time, regardless of item type.

- **Stone Transport Pipe (Stone)** - Very slow backbone connectivity with random routing
- **Copper Transport Pipe (Copper)** - Backbone connectivity with random routing
- **Item Extractor Pipe (Wood)** - Pull items from adjacent inventories into your network
- **Item Merger Pipe (Iron)** - All inputs converge to a single output
- **Golden Transport Pipe (Gold)** - Speed boost when powered by redstone
- **Item Passthrough Pipe (Sandstone)** - Connects only to pipes; bypasses inventories
- **Item Void Pipe (Obsidian)** - Delete unwanted items

### Tier 2: Smart Pipes (Implemented)
**Item-aware routing decisions**

These pipes are intelligent. They inspect items and change behavior based on what they see. This is where your network becomes conditional and responsive.

- **Item Filter Pipe (Diamond)** - Route specific items to specific destinations (item-aware)
- **Item Insertion Pipe (Quartz)** - Prefer inventories with space; otherwise route to pipes

### Tier 3: Network Logistics (Implemented)
**System-aware automation and requests**

Your inventories become abstract resources, and you request what you need—the network figures out the rest. Dedicated logistics pipes advertise contents, fulfill requests, maintain stock, and automate crafting. Chassis pipes hold swappable modules to customize behavior further.

- **Provider Logistics Pipe** - Advertises inventory contents to the network
- **Requester Logistics Pipe** - Requests items from the network on demand
- **Supplier Logistics Pipe** - Maintains target stock levels automatically
- **Crafting Logistics Pipe** - Automates crafting recipes on demand
- **Chassis Logistics Pipes (MK1–MK5)** - Hold 1–8 swappable modules each

Each tier builds on the previous one—you'll use all three together as your base grows.

## Features

Logistics includes a complete system for item transport, power generation, and automation.

### Pipes
Transport items through networks with different behaviors:
- **Basic Transport** - Stone and Copper pipes for backbone connectivity
- **Extraction & Routing** - Wood (extractor), Iron (merger), Diamond (filter), Quartz (insertion) pipes
- **Special Pipes** - Gold (speed boost), Sandstone (passthrough), Obsidian (void)
- **Network Logistics** - Dedicated logistics pipes (provider, requester, supplier, crafter, and more) plus chassis pipes with swappable modules

### Power
RF energy generation and distribution:
- **Redstone Engine** - Simple, safe, steady power
- **Stirling Engine** - Fuel-powered with heat management
- **Creative Engine** - Infinite power for testing and creative mode
- **Power Cable** - Distributes energy from engines to connected machines

### Automation
- **[Kiln](https://indemnity83.github.io/logistics/automation/kiln/)** - Temperature-controlled crafting for molten glass and advanced materials
- **[Macerator](https://indemnity83.github.io/logistics/automation/macerator/)** - Grind ores and materials into dusts and flour; supports XP drops and tag-based recipes
- **[Laser Quarry](https://indemnity83.github.io/logistics/automation/laser-quarry/)** - Automated 16×16 mining with energy-scaled speed

### Tools
- **[Wrench](https://indemnity83.github.io/logistics/tools/wrench/)** - Configuration tool for pipes and machines
- **[Marking Fluid](https://indemnity83.github.io/logistics/tools/marking-fluid/)** - Color-code your pipe networks
- **Probe** - Inspect network state (creative/debug tool)

## Installation

**Requirements:** Minecraft 1.21.11 • Fabric Loader 0.18.4+ • Fabric API • Java 21+

**Download from:**
- [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/indemnity83/logistics/releases) (includes dev builds)
- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/logistics) (stable releases)
- [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/logistics-automation) (stable releases)

[Full installation guide →](https://indemnity83.github.io/logistics/getting-started/install/)

---

## Quick Start

1. **Craft pipes** - Start with stone or copper transport pipes
2. **Connect to inventories** - Pipes automatically connect to chests and other storage
3. **Extract items** - Use wood extractor pipes (wrench to configure)
4. **Route and filter** - Combine different pipe types to build your network
